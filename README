oscopy -- An interactive program to view electrical results

ABOUT OSCOPY
------------
This is oscopy, a kind of oscilloscope in python, to view 2D electrical
simulation or measurement results.
It is designed to easily add new input data file formats and new types of plots.
Features highlight:
  * Post-processing: math expressions, fft, diffs
  * View, examine: multiple windows, cursors
  * Data import: gnucap
  * Data export: gnucap, pictures
  * Scripting
  * D-Bus support: update recursively signals
  * Run netlister and simulator

There are two interfaces:
  * Command-line interface (CLI): oscopy_app.py
  * Graphical user interface (GUI) fully integrating the CLI: oscopy_ui.py
Scripting is supported in both application, although in the GUI some commands are disabled since plots are displayed dynamically.

Support for mathematic with signals is implemented. Supported functions:
trig, sqrt, log... 
Support for (i)fft: fft(v1) + fft(v2) is possible, but please avoid things like ifft(fft(v1) + fft(v2))
First order diff is supported: diff(v1) or diff(v1, 1)
Access to X axis data is provided through Time and Freq, e.g. sin(Time(vsqu)*1e6)

In each plot window, horizontal and vertical cursors can be toggled by using keys '1', '2', '3' and '4'.

Support for drag'n drop from signal window to graphs is implemented.

GETTING THE SOURCE
------------------
The source can be downloaded from repo.cz:
http://repo.or.cz/w/oscopy.git

To download it:
$ git clone git://repo.or.cz/oscopy.git 

BUILDING FROM SOURCE
--------------------
Oscopy can work out of the box when downloaded, but it supports also installing on the system using autotools.
In the latter case:
$ ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make

Dependencies:
  * python
  * python-numpy
  * python-matplotlib
  * python-dbus
  * python-vte
  * python-xdg 

INSTALLING
----------
If you want to install oscopy on a system:
# ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make install
Note that you might need to update your PYTHONPATH, for example if you install it in ${HOME}/geda, to launch oscopy you might need the following line:
PYTHONPATH=${HOME}/geda/lib/python2.5/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH

If you want to use gschem integration, you will need to use the same --prefix that you used to install gschem.

QUICKSTART
----------
To run the program, just do ./oscopy_app or ./oscopy_ui.

To get any info on available commands, type 'help'.

A sample circuit is provided for demonstration purposes.

Using the GUI:
$ cd demo
$ ../oscopy_ui.py &
Just do "File>Run Netlister and simulate..." and fill in the window with the commands provided below
then in the terminal window:
oscopy> exec demo.oscopy

Using the CLI:
From oscopy directory, prepare the demo circuit files
$ cd demo
$ gnetlist -g spice-sdb -s -o demo.net demo.sch
$ gnucap -b demo.net
$ ../oscopy_app.py -b demo.oscopy

Using gschem integration:
If you want to use gschem integration, add (load-from-path "oscopy.scm") to your gschemrc, and you shoud see the oscopy menu on the next start of gschem. Note that you should have done ./configure --prefix="same prefix as gschem"
Then assuming you are in the oscopy directory:
  * launch gschem
  * open demo/demo.sch
  * oscopy>Launch oscopy
  * Follow the instruction in "Using the GUI". 
  * Once the script finished to execute, go back to gschem and change the value of a component e.g. the capacitor C.
  * oscopy>Update oscopy
  * once netlister and simulator ran, figures should have changes, e.g. figure 3 vout should have moved and vo not.

COMMAND REFERENCE
-----------------
add SIG [, SIG [, SIG]...]
   Add a graph to the current figure

create [SIG [, SIG [, SIG]...]]
   Create a new figure, set_ it as current, add the signals

delete GRAPH#
   Delete a graph from the current figure

destroy FIG#
   Destroy a figure

echo [TEXT]
   Print text

exec FILENAME
   execute commands from file

factors X, Y
   set the scaling factor of the graph (in power of ten)
   use 'auto' for automatic scaling factor
   e.g. factor -3, 6 set the scale factor at 1e-3 and 10e6

figlist
   Print the list of figures

freeze SIG [, SIG [, SIG]...]

layout horiz|vert|quad
   Define the layout of the current figure

math destsig=mathexpr
   Define a new signal destsig using mathematical expression
   destsig=mathexpr is also valid.

mode MODE
   Set the type of the current graph of the current figure
   Available modes :
   lin      Linear graph

   Set the axis range of the current graph of the current figure

read DATAFILE
   read signal file

remove SIG [, SIG [, SIG]...]
   Delete a list of signals into from current graph

scale [lin|logx|logy|loglog]
   Set the axis scale

select FIG#-GRAPH#
   Select the current figure and the current graph

siglist
   List loaded signals

unfreeze SIG [, SIG [, SIG]...]
   Consider signal for subsequent updates

unit [XUNIT,] YUNIT
   Set the unit to be displayed on graph axis
