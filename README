oscopy -- A program to view electrical simulation results

This is oscopy, an oscilloscope in python, to view 2D electrical
simulation results. It is designed to easily new input data file formats
and new types of plots.
This program use matplotlib to plot the data.

oscopy is an example of use of the available functions,
implemented as a simple command line program.

To run the program, just do ./oscopy.

To get any info on available commands, type 'help'.

EXAMPLE:
-------
gnetlist -g spice-sdb -s -o demo.net demo.sch
gnucap -b demo.net
./oscopy
load tran.dat
load ac.dat
add vsqu
v1=vsqu*3+2
siglist
add v1
add vsqu
mode fftlin
figlist
create
add vout
mode loglog
figlist
plot
(change something in demo.sch, e.g. vsqu amplitude)
update
plot

EXTENDING THE PROGRAM:
---------------------
New data file format can be added by deriving Reader and
redefining the function readsigs(), which fills the list
of signals self.sigs and return a dict of signals.
During execution, Reader.read() check the validity
of the provided path, and then call readsigs().

New graph mode can be added by deriving Graph and redefining
the function setaxes() which if called by plot(), or eventually 
redefining plot().
NOTE : Figure.setmode() has to be updated when new mode are added !

Vocabular:
A figure is CREATEd or DESTROYed, a graph is ADDed to a figure or DELETEd and a signal is INSERTed or REMOVEd from a graph.
