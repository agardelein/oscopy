scope -- A program to view electrical simulation results

This is scope, a program to view 2D electrical simulation results.
It is designed to easily new input data file formats, new
types of plots.
This program use matplotlib to plot the data.

scope is an example of use of the available functions,
implemented as a simple command line program.

To run the program, just do ./scope.

To get any info on available commands, type help.

EXAMPLE:
-------
./scope.py
load tran.dat
load ac.dat
add vsqu
v1=vsqu*3+2
siglist
add v1
add vsqu
fft
figlist
create
add vout
mode loglog
figlist
plot
(change something in deom.sch, e.g. vsqu amplitude)
update
plot

EXTENDING THE PROGRAM:
---------------------
New data file format can be added by deriving ReaderBase and
redefining the function getsiglist(), which fills the list
of signals self.siglist and return a dict of signals.
During execution, ReaderBase.loadfile() check the validity
of the provided path, and then call getsiglist().

New graph mode can be added by deriving BaseGraph and redefining
the function setaxes() which if called by plot(), or eventually 
redefining plot().
NOTE : Figure.setmode() has to be updated when new mode are added !

Vocabular:
A figure is CREATEd or DESTROYed, a graph is ADDed to a figure or DELETEd and a signal is INSERTed or REMOVEd from a graph.
