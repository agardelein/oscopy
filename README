EXTENDING THE PROGRAM:
---------------------
New data file format can be added by deriving ReaderBase and
redefining the function getsiglist(), which fills the list
of signals self.siglist and return a dict of signals.
During execution, ReaderBase.loadfile() check the validity
of the provided path, and then call getsiglist().

New graph type can be added by deriving BaseGraph and redefining
the function setaxes() which if called by plot(), or eventually 
redefining plot().
NOTE : Figure.settype() has to be updated !
