To be checked :
FFT: is X axis right ?

To be fixed :
All: add _ to the private methods and attributes

To be added :
Support for HDF5
Make Signal derive from numpy.array
Use property()
Signal.frozen to use property()
MathReader: just replace in expr v1 by sigs["v1"] and only eval the expression. This avoid exec a page-long string.
