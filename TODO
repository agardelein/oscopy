To be checked :
FFT: is X axis right ?

To be fixed :
Support for recursive maths (i.e. v1=vsqu*2+3 then v2=v1+6)
pylab.sin instead of math.sin, and replace sin by pylab.sin into expression
Update signal rather than readers. Use a kind of counter in Readers to distinguish between multiple call for the same update


To be added :
Support for HDF5

Open questions:
Missing signals when updating: keep or delete ?
